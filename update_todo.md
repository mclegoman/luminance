# Luminance Todo  
- Fix Hand Renderer.  
- Make sure Dynamic Uniforms' `_smooth`, `_delta`, etc are working as intended.  
- Add a way to override shader uniforms for specific shaders.
  - `Shader.Data` would be able to have a optional list of uniforms that specify the post_effect, uniform name, uniform values, and uniform overrides.
