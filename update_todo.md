# Luminance Todo  
- **Multi-loader for Fabric, Quilt, and NeoForge.**  
  - For this to be worked on, I want to have our own alternatives to the fabric api functions we use.  
    - Resource Packs, Keybindings, TickEvents  
- **Dynamic Uniforms**   
  - Add a uniform config.  
    - This would ideally be in the shader program json (and post_effect json) inside the uniform, and would allow the shader to specify data that the dynamic uniform can access.  
- **Entrypoints**  
  - Add Common, Server, and Pre-Launch entrypoints.
